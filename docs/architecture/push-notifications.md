## Infrastructure

**Expo Push API:** Free tier, rate limit 600 notifications/second. No external push service dependency beyond Expo.

**Client library:** `expo-server-sdk` — handles token validation, message chunking, batch sending, and error parsing.

## Token Management

Source: `apps/api/src/trpc/procedures/pushTokens.ts`

**Register:** `pushTokens.register` mutation. Accepts `{ token: string, platform: "ios" | "android" }`. Uses `onConflictDoUpdate` on the unique `token` column — if the same device token is registered by a different user (e.g., after logout + login on same device), ownership transfers to the new user.

**Unregister:** `pushTokens.unregister` mutation. Deletes the token for the current user. Called on logout.

**Multi-device:** One user can have multiple tokens (phone + tablet). All tokens receive the push.

**Stale token cleanup:** When Expo API returns a ticket with `status: "error"` and `details.error === "DeviceNotRegistered"`, the corresponding token row is deleted from the database immediately. This handles uninstalled apps and expired tokens.

## `sendPushToUser` Flow

Source: `apps/api/src/services/push.ts`

The central push function. Every push notification in the app goes through this single function.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **WS active check:** If the user has any active WebSocket connection (`isUserConnected()`), return immediately without sending push. The in-app real-time UI handles delivery.

2. **DND check:** Fetch `profiles.doNotDisturb` for the user. If `true`, return without sending. Server-side suppression — the push never reaches the device.

3. **Token fetch:** Query all push tokens for the user from `pushTokens` table.

4. **Token validation:** Filter tokens through `Expo.isExpoPushToken()`. Invalid tokens (malformed, wrong format) are silently skipped.

5. **Message assembly:** For each valid token, build an `ExpoPushMessage`:
   - `to`: the push token
   - `sound`: `"default"` for audible pushes, `undefined` for silent (when `collapseId` is set)
   - `title`, `body`: from caller payload
   - `data`: arbitrary JSON passed through to the client app
   - `_id`: set to `collapseId` when provided (Expo's collapse mechanism)

6. **Batch send:** Chunk messages via `expo.chunkPushNotifications()` and send each chunk via `expo.sendPushNotificationsAsync()`.

7. **Error handling:** Iterate tickets, delete tokens that got `DeviceNotRegistered`. All errors are caught and logged — push failures never crash the caller.

**Why fire-and-forget (`void sendPushToUser(...)`):** All call sites use `void` — push is a side effect that should not block the main mutation response. Failures are logged but don't affect the user's action.

## All Push Types (9 triggers)

| Trigger | Title | Body | collapseId | Sound | Source file |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| New wave (normal) | `"Blisko"` | `"{name} — nowy ping!"` | none | Yes | `waves.ts` |
| Mutual wave (both users) | `"Blisko"` | `"Pingowaliscie sie wzajemnie — to rzadkie!"` | none | Yes | `waves.ts` |
| Wave accepted | `"Blisko"` | `"{name} — ping przyjety!"` | none | Yes | `waves.ts` |
| DM message | `"{senderName}"` | `"{messagePreview}"` | none | Yes | `messages.ts` |
| Group message (first unread) | `"{groupName}"` | `"{senderName}: {preview}"` | none | Yes | `messages.ts` |
| Group message (has unreads) | `"{groupName}"` | `"{N} nowych wiadomosci"` | `"group:{conversationId}"` | No (silent) | `messages.ts` |
| Ambient status match | `"Blisko"` | `"Ktos z pasujacym profilem jest w poblizu"` | `"ambient-match"` | No (silent) | `queue.ts` |
| Group invite (create) | `"{groupName}"` | `"Nowe zaproszenie do grupy"` | none | Yes | `groups.ts` |
| Group invite (addMember) | `"{groupName}"` | `"Nowe zaproszenie do grupy"` | none | Yes | `groups.ts` |

### Wave push details

**New wave:** Sent to `input.toUserId`. Title is always "Blisko" (app name). Body includes sender's `displayName` with fallback to "Ktos". Data payload: `{ type: "wave", userId: senderId }` — client uses this to deep-link to the wave detail screen.

**Mutual wave:** When user A pings user B, and user B already has a pending wave to user A (within 30-second window), it's a mutual ping. Both users receive the same push text. Data payload: `{ type: "chat", conversationId }` — client opens the newly created conversation directly.

**Wave accepted:** Sent to the original wave sender (`wave.fromUserId`). Data payload: `{ type: "chat", conversationId }` — client opens the new conversation.

### Message push details

**DM:** Each participant (except sender) gets an individual push. Title is the sender's display name (personal feel, like iMessage). Body is the message content truncated for preview. Data: `{ type: "chat", conversationId }`.

**Group (first unread):** Same structure as DM but title is the group name (or sender name as fallback). This is the "heads up" notification that draws attention.

**Group (has unreads):** When a recipient already has unread messages (checked via `lastReadAt` comparison), the push becomes a silent update. The body changes from individual message preview to aggregate count (`"3 nowych wiadomosci"`). The `collapseId: "group:{conversationId}"` ensures the device replaces the previous notification rather than stacking.

### Ambient push details

**Status/proximity match:** Triggered by `sendAmbientPushWithCooldown()` in the queue processor — never directly from a tRPC procedure. The cooldown mechanism (see Ambient Push Cooldown section) ensures at most one push per hour per user. CollapseId `"ambient-match"` prevents stacking. Data: `{ type: "ambient_match" }`.

### Group invite details

**Create group with members:** When a group is created with initial members, each invited member receives a push. Sent outside the transaction (non-critical side effect).

**Add member to existing group:** Same push format as create. Triggered by the `addMember` mutation.

## Group Unread Suppression

**Problem:** Active group chats generate many messages quickly. Without suppression, users get buzzed for every single message — making group chats annoying.

**Solution:** CollapseId-based suppression using unread count detection.

**How it works:**

1. When a message is sent to a group conversation, the server counts unread messages per recipient (messages created after their `lastReadAt`)
2. `hasUnread` is `true` when `unreadCount > 1` (the "1" accounts for the message just inserted)
3. If `hasUnread` is false (this is the first unread message): send audible push with sender name and preview, no collapseId
4. If `hasUnread` is true (user already has unread messages): send silent push with `collapseId: "group:{conversationId}"`, body is `"{N} nowych wiadomosci"`. The collapseId causes the new push to replace the previous one on the device — user sees only the latest count
5. After the user reads messages (advancing `lastReadAt`), the next message triggers a fresh audible push again

**Why this design:** Mimics how iMessage handles group chats — first unread message makes noise, subsequent ones update silently. Prevents notification fatigue while ensuring the user knows something happened.

## DM: No Suppression

**What:** Every DM message triggers an audible push with the sender's name and message preview. No collapseId, no batching, no suppression.

**Why:** DMs are 1:1 conversations. Each message is individually important — like iMessage or WhatsApp. Suppressing would make the app feel unresponsive.

## Ambient Push Cooldown

**What:** Status matches and proximity matches trigger ambient push notifications. To prevent notification spam when a user is in a busy area, pushes are throttled per user.

**Mechanism:**
- Redis key: `ambient-push:{userId}`
- TTL: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Before sending: check if key exists (GET)
- If exists: skip push entirely
- If not: SET key with EX 3600, then send push

**Push payload when sent:** Title `"Blisko"`, body `"Ktos z pasujacym profilem jest w poblizu"`, collapseId `"ambient-match"`, data `{ type: "ambient_match" }`.

**Why 1 hour:** Status matches happen passively as users move around. In a dense area (conference, university campus), matches can fire every few minutes. One ambient push per hour is the upper bound of what feels "ambient" rather than "spammy."

**Why collapseId on ambient:** If two ambient pushes somehow slip through (race condition), the second replaces the first on the device rather than stacking.

## WebSocket Fallback (Push Suppression)

**What:** `sendPushToUser` checks `isUserConnected(userId)` first. If the user has any active WebSocket connection, push is skipped entirely.

**Why:** When the app is open and connected via WebSocket, real-time events are delivered instantly through the WS channel. The mobile client shows in-app banners for these events. Sending a push notification on top of the in-app banner would result in a duplicate alert — the phone buzzes while the user is already looking at the new message.

**How `isUserConnected` works:** Iterates the in-memory `clients` Set (all connected WS clients on this replica) looking for any connection where `ws.data.userId === userId`. Returns `true` on first match.

**Limitation:** Only checks the current replica's connections. If user is connected to replica B but the push is triggered on replica A, the check returns false and push is sent. In practice this rarely causes double-delivery because the user's tRPC calls (which trigger pushes) route to the same replica as their WS connection.

## Sound vs Silent Logic

The `sound` field in push messages is determined by a single rule: **if `collapseId` is set, the push is silent (`sound: undefined`); otherwise it's audible (`sound: "default"`).**

This means:
- All wave pushes: audible (no collapseId)
- All DM message pushes: audible (no collapseId)
- First group message (no unreads): audible (no collapseId)
- Subsequent group messages: silent (collapseId = `"group:{conversationId}"`)
- Ambient match: silent (collapseId = `"ambient-match"`)
- Group invites: audible (no collapseId)

**Why tie sound to collapseId:** CollapseId is used for notifications that update/replace previous ones. If the device already buzzed for the first notification, subsequent updates should silently replace the content without re-alerting. This is a UX decision: one buzz per "batch" of related events.

## Do Not Disturb (DND)

**What:** Users with `profiles.doNotDisturb = true` receive no push notifications at all. The suppression is server-side — the push is never sent to Expo.

**Data still stored:** Messages, waves, and other data are still written to the database. When DND is turned off, the user sees everything in-app — they just weren't notified in real-time.

**Why server-side (not client-side):** Server-side suppression saves Expo API quota and ensures zero device vibration/sound. Client-side DND would still cause the device to receive the notification (potentially showing briefly before being suppressed).

## Notification Data Payloads

Every push includes a `data` field that the mobile client uses for deep-linking:

| Data type | Value | Client behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `{ type: "wave", userId }` | New wave received | Navigate to wave detail / user profile |
| `{ type: "chat", conversationId }` | Message, mutual ping, wave accepted | Navigate to conversation |
| `{ type: "group", conversationId }` | Group invite | Navigate to group conversation |
| `{ type: "ambient_match" }` | Status match | Navigate to map (centered on current location) |

**Why structured data:** iOS and Android handle notification taps by passing the `data` object to the app's notification handler. The `type` field lets the client route to the correct screen without fetching additional context.

## Push Send Logging

Source: `apps/api/src/services/push-log.ts`, `apps/api/src/services/batch-buffer.ts`

Every call to `sendPushToUser()` logs the outcome — sent, suppressed (with reason), or failed — to the `push_sends` database table via a Redis-buffered batch writer.

**How it works:**

1. `sendPushToUser()` calls `logPushEvent()` at each exit point (fire-and-forget)
2. `logPushEvent()` calls `pushLogBuffer.append()` which does `RPUSH blisko:push-log <JSON>` (~0.1ms, never throws)
3. BullMQ repeatable job `flush-push-log` runs every 15s, atomically drains the Redis list, and batch-inserts all events into `push_sends`
4. BullMQ repeatable job `prune-push-log` runs every hour, deletes entries older than 7 days

**Suppression reasons recorded:**

| Reason | When |
|--------|------|
| `ws_active` | User has active WebSocket connection — in-app banner handles delivery |
| `dnd` | User has Do Not Disturb enabled |
| `no_tokens` | No push tokens registered for this user |
| `invalid_tokens` | Tokens registered but none pass `Expo.isExpoPushToken()` validation |

**Why batch via Redis:** Direct DB insert per push would add latency to the fire-and-forget hot path. Redis `RPUSH` is ~0.1ms and non-blocking. The batch flush means 1 DB INSERT per 15s regardless of push volume.

**Generic infrastructure:** `createBatchBuffer<T>()` in `batch-buffer.ts` is a reusable pattern — not push-specific. Any future feature needing low-overhead batch logging can use the same utility.

## Error Handling Philosophy

Push notification delivery is best-effort. The system is designed to never block user actions due to push failures:

1. **All call sites use `void`:** `sendPushToUser` returns a Promise, but callers discard it. The mutation response is sent to the client before push delivery completes.
2. **Entire function in try-catch:** Any error (DB query failure, Expo API error, network timeout) is caught, logged, and swallowed.
3. **Token cleanup is opportunistic:** Invalid tokens are cleaned up when Expo reports them, not proactively. A small number of stale tokens is acceptable.
4. **Redis cooldown fails open:** If Redis is unavailable for ambient push cooldown, the cooldown check returns early without error, and the push is sent. More pushes > no pushes.
5. **Push logging fails open:** If Redis is down, `logPushEvent()` silently skips — push delivery is unaffected.

## Impact Map

If you change this system, also check:
- **New push type:** Add entry to push types table above, decide on collapseId (group suppression vs always-audible), check if ambient cooldown applies
- **`pushTokens` schema:** Token registration, unregistration, and stale cleanup all rely on the current column structure
- **WS connection handling:** `isUserConnected()` iterates `clients` Set from `ws/handler.ts` — changes to connection lifecycle affect push suppression
- **Group conversation schema:** Unread suppression queries `conversationParticipants.lastReadAt` and counts messages — schema changes affect push behavior
- **DND feature:** Server-side suppression in `sendPushToUser()` — any push bypass (e.g., "critical" alerts) would need explicit DND override
- **Expo SDK upgrade:** `expo-server-sdk` handles chunking and error parsing — version changes may affect behavior
- **Redis availability:** Ambient push cooldown depends on Redis — if Redis is down, cooldown fails open (no cooldown = more pushes, not fewer)
- **Multi-replica:** `isUserConnected()` only checks local replica — adding sticky sessions or a shared connection registry would improve push suppression accuracy
- **Ambient push cooldown TTL:** Changing 3600s affects how often users get ambient match notifications — too low = spam, too high = missed matches
- **Push log (`push_sends` table):** Admin push log page reads from this table. Batch buffer uses Redis list `blisko:push-log`. Prune job deletes entries older than 7 days
- **`batch-buffer.ts`:** Generic utility — changes affect all batch buffer consumers (currently only push log)
